# corTree is the tree and nothing else: the node, building and editing a tree,
# lookup, clone, sort. No parser and no renderer - those are corJson, and any
# other format (XML, YAML, the binary one) is a sibling of corJson that produces
# or consumes the same tree.
#
# Every library in this stack is a SIBLING repo - `-I..` and `../<name>/lib<name>.a`
# is the layout, and it is part of the build contract rather than a convenience.
